A) the lower interest rate stimulates investment demand, which causes the AD curve to shift to  . Real GDP rises to $805 billion and the price level rises to 102.
B) the lower interest rate stimulates an increase in the demand for money, which causes the MD curve to shift to  . The interest rate rises to 3%.
C) the lower interest rate causes wages and other factor prices to rise, which causes the AS curve to shift to  . Real GDP falls to $795 billion and the price level rises to 102.
D) the higher interest rate causes wages and other factor prices to rise, which causes the AS curve to shift to  . Real GDP falls to $795 billion and the price level rises to 102.
