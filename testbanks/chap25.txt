A) high; interest rate and encourages more investment
B) high; wealth of people and increases future consumption
C) high; availability of funds, thus lowering the interest rate

3) A former Governor of the Bank of Canada argued that high interest rates tend to accompany high inflation because inflation
A) causes the Canadian dollar to appreciate which again fuels inflation even more.
B) erodes the value of the dollar and therefore lenders need to be compensated through higher interest rates.
C) reduces banks' profits who then respond by lowering their lending rates.
D) increases housing prices so younger Canadians are made worse off.
E) lowers short term interest rates and acts as an incentive to borrow money.

4) A former governor of the Bank of Canada argued that interest rates must be increased in order to reduce inflation, and this would ultimately result in lower interest rates. This apparent contradiction can be explained by noting that 
A) higher interest rates in the short run put downward pressure on inflation which, in turn, lowers demand for borrowed funds, thus decreasing interest rates in the long run.
B) higher interest rates promote saving which increases the supply of funds for lending and, other things constant, drives the "price" of borrowing down.
C) interest rates move in cycles and therefore tend to rise before they fall.
D) the Governor of the Bank of Canada is typically a patronage appointment with little formal training or knowledge of economic theory.
E) increasing interest rates increases inflation in the short run, but decreases inflation in the long run.
